## Preface, Purpose, and Administration

## P.1. Purpose of the Policy

## P.1.1 Importance of Collaboration with Industry

Mass General Brigham ('MGB'), its Affiliated Institutions, their leadership, and their individuals have a long history of supporting collaborations with Industry and other Outside Entities.  Preserving these relationships is essential because they advance MGB's mission of providing, promoting, and supporting high quality and leading edge patient care, research, and medical education.

At the same time, MGB recognizes that conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflict of interest, may arise from these interactions. These conflicts create a risk that integrity, independence, leadership, exercise of professional judgment, or the reputation of MGB may be compromised. However, in most cases these risks are manageable and the relationships are encouraged and allowed because of their importance to the advancement of MGB's mission.

Interactions with Industry and other Outside Entities also have the potential to create conflicts of commitment, in that Outside Activities or Financial Interests may deter individuals from devoting an appropriate amount of time, energy, creativity, or other personal resources to their MGB responsibilities. Here too, these risks are generally manageable and do not prevent relationships from going forward.

To assure that these relationships are reviewed consistently with these values, MGB has adopted this Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities to evaluate and appropriately address these relationships.

Note : The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Except for Section 1.2.3, terms in this Policy that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.  Italicized terms in Section 1.2.3 shall have the meaning specified in the HMS Conflicts Policy.

## P.1. Purpose of the Policy, Continued

## P.1.2 Definition Of Conflict Of Interest

For purposes of this Policy, a 'conflict of interest' refers in general to 'a set of circumstances that creates a risk that professional judgment or actions regarding a primary interest will be unduly influenced by a secondary interest' (Institute of Medicine, 2009).

These circumstances include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Those where outside financial or other interests may inappropriately influence the way the individual carries out his or her MGB responsibilities, or
- · Those where an individual's outside interests may be adverse to MGB, or
- · Those where an individual has the opportunity to use his or her MGB position for personal financial gain.

The determination of the existence of a conflict of interest, according to the standards specified above, is based on an evaluation of relevant facts and circumstances by the decision-making entity designated in this Policy for that particular context, as may be more specifically detailed in this Policy.

## P.1.3 Purpose The purpose of the Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities is to

- · Maintain the highest standards of integrity and professionalism in all MGB activities and affairs
- · Support principled relationships with Industry and other Outside Entities that advance patient care, research, and medical education consistent with these standards, and
- · Preserve public confidence that these standards are and will be maintained.

## P.2.3 ERB Responsibilities

Subject to certain reserved authorities of PICC, ERB oversees industry support for MGB educational activities.  ERB reviews and approves all industry-support for MGB educational activities by applying, interpreting, and articulating policies related to industry-supported education.

In performing its functions, ERB has the authority to develop, adopt, and oversee implementation of details of policies for review of industry support for educational activities; to review and act on industry support proposals; to ensure compliance with applicable internal and external policy requirements; to ensure the appropriate level of content review for industry-supported educational activities; to review relevant financial relationships of individuals providing content for such programs or soliciting/spending gifts to support such programs; to establish monitoring programs and work with COA and relevant officials on appropriate sanctions of policies; to develop, adopt, and oversee implementation of such policies as are necessary for compliance with applicable laws; to refer any case or issue to PICC; and to take whatever actions are necessary to implement this Policy or are consistent with its formal charge or other authority delegated to it.

OII assists PICC, COA, ERB, and their delegates with the administration of this Policy.

- · OII has the authority to refer matters to COA or ERB, as appropriate, or to their respective delegates for assessment and action required by this Policy.
- · OII has the authority to develop procedures, guidelines, forms, and tools it considers necessary and appropriate to fulfill its responsibilities under this Policy.

| Financial   Conflicts of  Interest   Continued | All MGB  Researchers  | A1.  Clinical Research Rule (The 'I(a) Rule'):   It is presumed that Researchers who Participate in Clinical Research  may not have a Financial Interest (Equity or Income) exceeding the de  minimis thresholds in a Business whose Technology is being  investigated. The presumption may be overcome when, in the  judgment of the HMS Standing Committee on Conflicts of Interest  and Commitment (Standing Committee) or its designee, individuals  holding presumptively prohibited Financial Interests present  demonstrable, compelling justification - consistent with the rights and  welfare of Clinical Research subjects - for being permitted to  simultaneously hold the Financial Interest and Participate in the  Clinical Research.  De Minimis Thresholds: Researchers may receive  $25,000 or less  annually 1  from a Business in the form of  Income  (e.g., consulting fees or  other remuneration for services) and still Participate in Clinical Research  on the Business's Technology. Furthermore, Researchers may have an  Equity Financial Interest of $50,000 or less  in a publicly held Business  and continue to Participate in Clinical Research on the Business's  Technology so long as the equity was not given in connection with the  Clinical Research at issue.  Holding any equity in a privately held  Company is presumed to be prohibited.  Duration of Restriction: A Researcher must be free of all Financial  Interests above the de minimis thresholds from a relevant Business prior to  commencing the Clinical Research. Participation in Clinical Research  shall apply for the entire duration of the Clinical Research and the rule  continues to apply even should the Researcher elect to terminate Clinical  Research activities.   2 The rule shall apply until the date that is the later of (i) six (6) months  following the last day that a human study participant completes the  Clinical Research (e.g., data lock plus 6 months), or (ii) the first  Publication of data derived from the Clinical Research, or a decision not to  publish the data derived from Clinical Research. |

1 The payments may be considered to be accrued by the Researcher on the date of service or on the date of receipt of the payments so long as the Researcher is consistent in the treatment of such payments.

2 A Researcher may petition for relief from the application of the Clinical Research Rule to the entire period set forth here. If granted, however, the expectation is that Participation has been surrendered for the duration of the Clinical Research.

| All MGB  Researchers,  continued | Dual-Career Family Exception: Upon petition to the Standing Committee, a  Researcher may overcome the presumption that s/he may not Participate in  Clinical Research or receive Research support if (i) the conflict arises  solely by virtue of the career  pursuits of the Researcher's spouse or  domestic partner, (ii) the Standing Committee determines, in its discretion,  that strict application of one or both of the rules under the circumstances  would unduly inhibit scientific progress, and (iii) any potential conflict of  interest is one that the Standing Committee finds, in its discretion, can be  managed adequately through a formal management plan.  Institutional License/Royalty Sharing Agreement Exception: Upon petition  to the Standing Committee, a Researcher may overcome the presumption  that s/he may not Participate in Clinical Research or receive Research  support if (i) the conflict arises solely because of income received through  an institutional license or royalty sharing agreement, (ii) the Standing  Committee determines, in its discretion, that strict application of the rule  under the circumstances presented is unduly restrictive after weighing the  merits of allowing the Research to go forward and the risks of the potential  conflict of interest, and (iii) the potential conflict arising by reason of the  income received through the institutional agreement can be managed |
| All MGB  Researchers             | A2.  Research Support Rule (The 'I(b) Rule'):   It is presumed that Researchers who have an Equity Financial Interest  above the de minimis threshold in a Business may not receive  Sponsored Research support from that Business for Research. The  presumption may be overcome when, in the judgment of the Standing  Committee or its designee, individuals holding presumptively  prohibited Equity Financial Interests present sufficient countervailing  circumstances (the benefits of the proposed Research must outweigh  the risks, and the Financial Interest must be able to be appropriately  managed) for being permitted to simultaneously hold the Equity  Financial Interest and receive Sponsored Research support.  De minimis Threshold for Researcher's Equity Financial Interest in  Publicly Traded Business: A Researcher may have an Equity Financial  Interest of  one percent or less  in a  publicly traded  Business and  Participate in Research using Sponsored Research support from the  Business so long as (a) the Business was not founded by the Researcher, or  (b) the equity was not acquired in connection with the Research at issue.  Any interest exceeding 1% of the publicly traded Business's value would  require an exception from the Standing Committee or its designee.  Holding  any equity in a privately held Business is presumed to be prohibited.                                                    |

| Financial   Conflicts of  Interest   Continued | All MGB  Researchers,  continued | Review of Faculty Equity Financial Interest in a Privately Held Business:  Any Equity Financial Interest in a privately held Business will require an  exception from the Standing Committee or its Designee to Participate in  Research using Sponsored Research support from the Business. The de  minimis threshold does not apply to privately held Businesses.  Duration of Restriction: A Researcher must be free of all Equity Financial  Interests above the de minimis threshold from a relevant Business prior to   commencing the Sponsored Research. Participation in the Sponsored  Research shall apply for the entire duration of the Sponsored Research and  rule continues to apply even should one elect to terminate Sponsored  Research activities.   3 The rule shall apply until the date that is the later of (i) six (6) months  following the last day that data is collected (e.g., data lock plus 6 months),  or (ii) the first Publication of data derived from the Sponsored Research,  or a decision not to publish the data derived from the Sponsored Research.  SBIR/STTR Exception: If the anticipated Sponsored Research support that  will violate the Research Support Rule will be through a subgrant under  the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program or the Small  Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Program 4 , the involved Researcher  may conduct the Research notwithstanding the Equity Financial Interest if  the institution that will be responsible for administering the SBIR/STTR  subgrant determines that any potential conflict of interest held by the  Researcher, given his or her equity interest in the small Business, may be  managed effectively with an institutional management plan. This  exception does not apply to Clinical Research. This exception is subject to  additional restriction and/or prohibition based on applicable federal law  and institutional policy. |

3 A Researcher may petition for relief from the application of the Research Support Rule to the entire period set forth there. If granted, however, the expectation is that Participation has been surrendered for the duration of the Sponsored Research.

4 The Standing Committee on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment or an affiliate COI Committee may determine that other grant programs of a similar structure and aim to the SBIR/STTR programs warrant consideration under this exception and may grant these exceptions following review.

## Section 2 Clinical Care and Interactions with Industry

## 2.1. Policy Overview

## 2.1.1 Policy

Collaborations between MGB Individuals providing patient care and Industry present unique opportunities to improve and advance patient care.  However, these collaborations must be carefully managed to avoid improper influence and inducements in clinical care.  MGB encourages such collaborations, subject to the requirements of this Section 2.

MGB Individuals subject to this Section 2 are responsible for compliance with this Section.

Note: The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 2 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

A clinical conflict of interest may exist when a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 has a personal Financial Interest or Outside Activity with a manufacturer of a drug, device, or other products for use in patient care, according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA, which could influence or be perceived as influencing his/her clinical decisionmaking or interactions with his/her patients.

A clinical conflict of interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug, device, or other technology and, under institutional royalty-sharing policies, a MGB Individual subject to this Section 2 shares in those royalties according to thresholds that may be established from time to time by COA and uses the drug, device, or other technology in his/her clinical practice at MGB.

## 2.3.2

Management of Clinical Conflicts of Interest

## 2.3.3 Disclosure to Patients

## 2.3.4

Clinical Care and Royalties Through the Institution

Because of the special circumstances associated with the physician-patient relationships and the exigencies of clinical care situations, management of any clinical conflict of interest shall be tailored to fit individual circumstances. Possible management mechanisms for clinical conflicts of interest shall be determined by COA.  They may include but are not limited to one or more of the following:

- · Disclosure of the interest or activity, in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.3.3;
- · Corroboration through a disinterested process of any prescription involving a product or device of a Company in which the clinical conflict of interest exists;
- · Review of practice patterns;
- · Reduction or elimination of the conflict; and
- · Transfer of clinical care to an alternate clinician.

COA may determine in particular cases that clinical conflicts of interest, according to thresholds established by COA, warrant individualized patient disclosure before a MGB Individual covered by this Section 2 prescribes or uses that Company's medical device, pharmaceutical, or medical care-related product in connection with the care of his/her individual patients.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed to a Company must state, as an exception to any requirement that the Company pay royalties to MGB, that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific non-MGB charitable organization.

## 3.1.2 Description of Industry Support of Education

## Section 3 Industry Support Related to Education

## 3.1 Policy Overview

## 3.1.1 Rationale and Policy Statement

Industry support for MGB Educational Activities helps to further MGB ability to carry out its educational mission.  However, these situations need to be carefully managed to ensure that such support does not introduce bias into the content of MGB Educational Activities.  MGB encourages such support, subject to the requirements of this Section 3.

All MGB Educational Activities supported by Industry must comply with the policy requirements imposed by the Education Review Board (ERB), as described in more detail in this Section 3.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 3 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

Note : These policy requirements do not cover the participation of MGB Individuals in Industry-funded external educational activities not put on or sponsored by MGB.  Such activities are covered by Section 4 Consulting and Other Outside Activities , and Section 6 Gifts , below.

Industry support may be provided through:

- · Monetary support, or
- · In-kind support.

These two types of support may be directed to a specific MGB Educational Activity so long as such support is accepted in compliance with Section 3.3. Additionally, monetary support may be directed to a President's Fund for Medical Education so long as such support is accepted in compliance with Section 3.4.

All MGB Educational Activities with Industry support for which professional medical or other healthcare education credit is not offered must still meet the Industry-support standards for accreditation in the respective professional field (e.g., a program designed for physicians must meet ACCME Standards for Commercial Support, a program designed for nurses must meet the American Nurses Credentialing Center's Commission on Accreditation standards).  For programs in fields for which there are no such standards, standards will apply as established by the ERB.

Industry may not control the selection of speakers or content of the MGB Educational Activity.

Industry support for a specific MGB Educational Activity must come from more than one Industry entity, in accordance with conditions imposed by the ERB and subject to exceptions granted by the ERB.  Generally, no one Industry entity can provide more than 70% of the total commercial support.

All program/course directors, speakers, moderators, panelists, others as determined by the ERB must report their Financial Interests and Outside Activities that are related to the MGB Educational Activity, as required on any applicable forms or other disclosure processes, and must be resolved by ERB prior to the educational activity start date.

4.2.3 Prohibited Outside Activities

Consulting and other Outside Activities undertaken by MGB Individuals are encouraged and in most cases allowable according to the provisions of this Section 4.  These provisions establish oversight requirements and minimize the possibility of inappropriate considerations affecting the exercise of MGB responsibilities.  However, for a limited variety of Outside Activities, the potential for negative impact on the integrity of MGB missions is high, and accordingly, certain Outside Activities are prohibited.

## A.  Certain Company or Other Outside Entity Speaking and Training Engagements

Many speaking and training engagements for Companies or Other Outside Entities are encouraged, including CME presentations sponsored by accredited CME providers.  However, other engagements may compromise the independence and the reputation of the speaker and of MGB to such an extent that they are not allowed.  These engagements are described below.

Neither a Covered Individual, nor any other MGB Individual who is Acting in a MGB Capacity (except outside Trustees, Directors, and committee members),  may participate in:

- · Any arrangement or speaking engagement that is termed a 'Speakers Bureau'; or
- · Any speaking engagement for which a Company or Other Outside Entity has the contractual right to control what the individual says or otherwise has the final right of approval for content and edits of the individual's presentation materials; or
- · Any arrangement between an individual and a Company or Other Outside Entity
- o under which an agreement indicates that the speaker's name will be on a list of speakers or potential speakers; or
- o under which the individual will be engaged in promotional activity for the Company or Other Outside Entity; or
- · Any other exceptional circumstances as determined by the Committee on Conflicts of Interest (COA), including but not limited to excessive frequency of, or excessive compensation for, speaking engagements.

## B.  Set In Advance

The aggregate compensation or the compensation methodology for consulting or other Outside Activities must be set in advance.

## C.  Arms Length

All agreements must be negotiated at 'arms-length' and must not take into account the volume or value of referrals or other business generated between or among MGB, the Covered Individual and the Outside Entity.

- · Advertising,
- · Promotional, or
- · Other public or printed material.

An individual subject to this Section is responsible for informing the Outside Entity of this restriction.

## Allowed Usage of MGB Entity Name

An Individual subject to this Section may use the name of a MGB entity to identify the Individual's position or title at MGB, so long as the use does not imply MGB endorsement or responsibility for the Outside Activity, the Outside Entity, or the Outside Entity's product or services.

Exceptions may be made by the Covered Individual's supervisor provided that the activity is unlikely to and in fact does not adversely affect the interests of MGB or the ability of the Covered Individual to carry out his or her MGB responsibilities, and is otherwise acceptable.  The supervisor may impose restrictions or limitations as deemed appropriate in his or her judgment.

This Section 4.2.7 is not intended to apply to consulting or other Outside Activities or to research collaborations with other health care providers entered into by MGB and that involve Researchers, provided they comply with this Section 4 and other applicable institutional policies.  COA may provide for additional exceptions to this Section 4.2.7.

A Written Agreement is required when an Outside Activity is with a pharmaceutical, medical device, or biotechnology Company or other Company that provides, has provided, or is likely to provide goods or services to MGB.

Examples :  Examples of entities that may provide goods or services to MGB include:

Issues

Supervisors have the right to review any and all Outside Activities, whether or not covered by a Written Agreement, of Covered Individuals who report to them.

Supervisors have the right and authority to disapprove any Outside Activity if, in the supervisor's judgment, the amount of time, compensation, or other factors would interfere with the Covered Individual's MGB responsibilities.

In reviewing and deciding whether to approve an Outside Activity, supervisors may take into account any relevant factors, including the Covered Individual's:

- · Level of seniority
- · Authority, and
- · Administrative responsibilities.

For example, supervisors may limit the amount of time devoted to Outside Activities or the amount of compensation received.

If a supervisor has a personal Financial Interest above thresholds established by COA in a matter for which he or she has supervisory responsibility pursuant to this Section 4, the supervisor must recuse himself or herself from acting on the matter and shall refer the matter to his or her supervisor.

If any issue reviewed by a supervisor is not resolved in the normal course of business, the COA has the authority to resolve the issue.

## 4.7. Standard Requirements for a Written Agreement

## 4.7.1 Time

Each Written Agreement must contain sufficient evidence that the committed time will be within allowable limits, preferably by specifying the maximum number of days committed through that Written Agreement.

## 4.7.2 Restriction on Use of MGB Name

## 4.7.3 Scope and Field of Services

## 4.7.4 Overlap with Field of Research

Except for minimal risk circumstances approved by the OII, every Written Agreement must state that Outside Entities do not have the right to use the logo or name of any MGB entity in any form in any advertising, promotional or other public material without the prior written approval of the MGB entity involved.

- · A Covered Individual may use the name of a MGB entity (in connection with an Outside Activity) to identify the Individual's position or title at MGB, so long as the use, in the judgment of COA, does not imply MGB endorsement or responsibility for the Outside Activity, the Outside Entity, or the Outside Entity's product or services, unless otherwise restricted by COA.

Written Agreements:

- · Should clearly specify all of the services, including scope and field of those services, to be provided by the Covered Individual, and
- · Must not provide for services that compete or overlap inappropriately with the individual's obligations to MGB.

If the field of activity in any Outside Activity overlaps with the field of research conducted by the Covered Individual at or through MGB, then the following additional requirements apply.

- · If the Covered Individual's research at MGB is sponsored by the Outside Entity with which the Covered Individual is entering into the Written Agreement, the intellectual property provisions of the Written Agreement for the Outside Activity must not be so broad as to purport to grant to the Outside Entity ownership of or other rights in any intellectual property that may arise from, or relate to, the sponsored research agreement between the Outside Entity and MGB.

## 5.1. Policy Overview

## 5.1.1 Policy Statement

Collaborations among MGB, MGB Individuals, and Industry provide opportunities for productive collaboration and foster the exchange of knowledge and information that leads to advances in science and patient care. However, MGB Financial Interests in Industry, including Financial Interests of Institutional Officials and other supervisory personnel, may result in inappropriate influence, or the appearance of inappropriate influence, on MGB charitable activities.  MGB requires that these Interests receive special review and oversight, as described in this Section 5.

Note :  The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions.  Other terms in this Section 5 that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary.

## 5.1.2 Section 5 Apply?

## 5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial Interests

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments

Sometimes MGB acquires equity (stock, stock options, or similar ownership interests) outside the normal Treasury investment and Development Office acquisition processes.  In most cases this happens as a result of a license of institutional technology or investments relating to technology or start-up Company activities.  Such equity is referred to here as 'Special Equity.'

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB holds Special Equity in a Company and conducts Clinical Research on or clinical validation of technology of that Company.

Accordingly, MGB adopts a rebuttable presumption that a MGB Affiliated Institution may not conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company, or validate or test on patients the unvalidated technology of a Company, (collectively referred to in this Section 5.2.1 as Clinical Research/Validation) if it or any other MGB Affiliated Institution simultaneously holds Special Equity in the Company.

The presumption may be overcome only if:

- (a) COA determines that there are demonstrable, compelling circumstances, consistent with the rights and welfare of clinical research subjects, for the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation while it or any other MGB institution holds special equity; OR
- (b) COA determines that the Clinical Research/Validation will be conducted at a different MGB Affiliated Institution from the one that owns or stands to benefit financially from the equity, and that individuals at the Affiliated Institution that owns or stands to benefit from the equity have no significant supervisory or other authority over the Researchers in the Clinical Research/Validation; OR
- (c) COA determines that the benefits of the MGB Affiliated Institution conducting the Clinical Research/Validation outweigh the risks, and the Clinical Research/Validation has been determined by the IRB to present no more than minimal risk to the subjects participating in it.

5.2. Policy Requirements for Certain Institutional Financial Interests, Continued

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments Continued

If the presumption is overcome under (a), (b), or (c), the Clinical Research/Validation may proceed only if COA determines that the equity holding can be appropriately managed, pursuant to a COA-approved management plan directed at protection of the integrity of the Clinical Research/Validation and the human subjects participating in it.  PICC shall have the authority to review any decision by COA pursuant to this Section5.2.1 that has significant financial implications for MGB.

For purposes of this section 5.2.1, Clinical Research/ Validation shall not include research that is determined by the Institutional Review Board and/ or COA to be Nominal Risk Clinical Research. Such Nominal Risk Clinical Research/ Validation is not subject to the rebuttable presumption above, but may proceed only pursuant to a management plan approved by COA, which authority is delegable by COA to OII.

Factors that may be relevant to the analysis of whether compelling circumstances exist for the Clinical Research/Validation include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · The nature of the science involved;
- · A description of the institutional financial interest and how closely it is linked to the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The degree to which the interest may be affected by the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · The magnitude of the potential risks to subjects or integrity inherent in the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · How those risks could be affected as a result of the institutional financial interest;
- · Whether the MGB Affiliated Institution is uniquely qualified, by virtue of its attributes (e.g. special facilities or equipment, unique patient population) and its researchers, to conduct the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · The degree to which the institutional conflict of interest can be effectively managed.

Continued

## Interests,

5.2.1 Institutional Equity Acquired Outside Treasury Investments Continued

Possible elements of associated management plans may include, but are not limited to, the following:

- · Special oversight of human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation, for example, through additional internal monitoring mechanisms or through an external IRB or DSMB;
- · Increasing or establishing firewalls or other conflicts management systems to separate financial decision-making from decision-making about the Clinical Research/Validation;
- · Independent data monitoring to ensure validity, through an objective individual or individuals outside the MGB Affiliated Institution with no ties to the Clinical Research/Validation or to the outside entity;
- · Disclosure of institutional conflicts as defined in this Section 5 in all relevant settings, including to human subjects involved in the Clinical Research/Validation; or
- · Modification or restriction of the MGB Affiliated Institution's financial interest, through lock-up provisions, divestiture, or the like.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives or has the potential to receive significant license payments from the sale of technology that is the subject of Clinical Research conducted at that Institution.  These license payments include, but are not limited to:

- · Upfront payments
- · Milestone payments, and
- · Royalties.

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research on the technology of a Company that is subject to a license or option to license from that Institution and that Institution is receiving license payments, above a threshold established by COA, from the sale of that technology, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing its analysis, COA may take into account any factors that it deems relevant to the analysis.

## 5.2.3 Oversight of Major Gifts and Research

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when a MGB Affiliated Institution receives substantial gifts from a Company:

- · That sponsors Clinical Research at that Institution or
- · Whose technology is proposed to be studied or tested in Clinical Research at that Institution.

## Requirement for COA Review and Approval

When OII determines that a MGB Affiliated Institution proposes to conduct Clinical Research sponsored by, or on the technology of, a Company from which that Institution has received substantial gifts above thresholds established by the COA, including gifts in kind, the proposed research must be reviewed and approved by COA before the research begins at that Institution.  In performing this analysis, COA may take into account any factors it deems relevant to the analysis.

Institutional Conflicts of Interest may arise when MGB receives royalties derived from the sales of particular drugs or devices to MGB.

License agreements under which MGB technology is licensed by MGB to a Company must state that the Company will not pay royalties derived from the sales of a particular drug or device to MGB, unless the COA approves an arrangement under which all such royalties will be donated to a specific nonMGB charitable organization.

- · That sponsors research (or that is proposing to sponsor research) conducted by the supervisor's direct reports, or
- · Whose technology is (or is proposed to be) the subject of research conducted by the supervisor's direct reports.

COA may impose restrictions on and implement management mechanisms for the supervisor with respect to oversight of such research.

- · Note:  A MGB Individual participating in research may request COA's review of a potential conflict of interest, as defined in this section, of his or her direct supervisor with respect to that research.  COA shall have the prerogative to decide whether the relationship merits management.
- · Direct supervisors of research may request OII or COA review of any potential conflict.
- · COA can review other situations where appropriate.
