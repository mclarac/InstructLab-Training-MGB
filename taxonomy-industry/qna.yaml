  Policy for interacting with industry and other outside entities.
seed_examples:
- context: |
  Mass General Brigham ('MGB'), its Affiliated Institutions, their leadership, and their individuals have a long history of supporting collaborations with Industry and other Outside Entities. Preserving these relationships is essential because they advance MGB's mission of providing, promoting, and supporting high quality and leading edge patient care, research, and medical education.

  At the same time, MGB recognizes that conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflict of interest, may arise from these interactions. These conflicts create a risk that integrity, independence, leadership, exercise of professional judgment, or the reputation of MGB may be compromised. However, in most cases these risks are manageable and the relationships are encouraged and allowed because of their importance to the advancement of MGB's mission.

  Interactions with Industry and other Outside Entities also have the potential to create conflicts of commitment, in that Outside Activities or Financial Interests may deter individuals from devoting an appropriate amount of time, energy, creativity, or other personal resources to their MGB responsibilities. Here too, these risks are generally manageable and do not prevent relationships from going forward.

  To assure that these relationships are reviewed consistently with these values, MGB has adopted this Mass General Brigham Policy for Interactions with Industry and Other Outside Entities to evaluate and appropriately address these relationships.

  Note: The term 'MGB' refers to Mass General Brigham Incorporated and/or one or more of its Affiliated Institutions. Except for Section 1.2.3, terms in this Policy that have initial capital letters shall have the meaning specified in the Glossary. Italicized terms in Section 1.2.3 shall have the meaning specified in the HMS Conflicts Policy.

  - question: |
      Why does MGB support collaborations with Industry and other Outside Entities?
    answer: |
      Because these relationships help advance MGB's mission of providing, promoting, and supporting high quality and leading edge patient care, research, and medical education.
  - question: |
      What kinds of risks may arise from MGB's interactions with Outside Entities?
    answer: |
      Conflicts of interest and the appearance of conflict of interest, which could compromise integrity, independence, leadership, professional judgment, or the reputation of MGB.
  - question: |
      Are conflicts of interest always prohibited in MGB's relationships with Outside Entities?
    answer: |
      No. Most of the time, these risks are manageable, and the relationships are encouraged and allowed because they are important to MGB's mission.

  ##### Researcher Disclosure Requirements and Prohibited Activities

  Researchers are required to disclose their Financial Interests, including but not limited to Significant Financial Interests, and other Outside Activities with Industry or other Outside Entities that reasonably appear to be related to their Institutional Responsibilities. Disclosure is required in the following ways:

  - Researchers must complete the annual MGB disclosure statement when requested.
  - At various times, in forms specified by MGB, researchers must disclose requested information such as Significant Financial Interests. Examples include submitting human subjects research protocols, research funding submissions, and starting new consulting or Outside Activities.
  - Researchers funded by the Public Health Service must update disclosures within 30 days of discovering or acquiring a new Significant Financial Interest.
  - These researchers must also disclose reimbursed or sponsored travel, including the purpose, sponsor, destination, and duration.
  - Researchers conducting research funded by foundations or other entities that require Public Health Service standards must follow those same standards.

  Disclosable Interests under section 1.2.2 include, but are not limited to, Significant Financial Interests defined in 42 CFR Part 50 and Part 54, 60 FR 35811, and any updates. These apply to:

  - Any research supported by the U.S. Public Health Service.
  - Any other research designated by the Committee on Outside Activities (COA).

  MGB and HMS policies also identify certain activities as impermissible. Section 1.2.3 of this Policy aligns with the HMS Policy on Conflicts of Interest and Commitment (HMS Conflicts Policy), with extensions:

  - Sections A1, A2, and A3 apply HMS requirements to all Researchers, regardless of HMS appointment.

    answer: |
      They must disclose reimbursed or sponsored travel, including the travel’s purpose, the identity of the sponsor or organizer, the destination, and the duration.

  - question: |

     4.6.4 COA Authority for Unresolved

Issues

Supervisors have the right to review any and all Outside Activities, whether or not covered by a Written Agreement, of Covered Individuals who report to them.

Supervisors have the right and authority to disapprove any Outside Activity if, in the supervisor's judgment, the amount of time, compensation, or other factors would interfere with the Covered Individual's MGB responsibilities.

In reviewing and deciding whether to approve an Outside Activity, supervisors may take into account any relevant factors, including the Covered Individual's:

- · Level of seniority
- · Authority, and
- · Administrative responsibilities.

For example, supervisors may limit the amount of time devoted to Outside Activities or the amount of compensation received.

If a supervisor has a personal Financial Interest above thresholds established by COA in a matter for which he or she has supervisory responsibility pursuant to this Section 4, the supervisor must recuse himself or herself from acting on the matter and shall refer the matter to his or her supervisor.

If any issue reviewed by a supervisor is not resolved in the normal course of business, the COA has the authority to resolve the issue.

## 4.7. Standard Requirements for a Written Agreement

## 4.7.1 Time

Each Written Agreement must contain sufficient evidence that the committed time will be within allowable limits, preferably by specifying the maximum number of days committed through that Written Agreement.

## 4.7.2 Restriction on Use of MGB Name

## 4.7.3 Scope and Field of Services

## 4.7.4 Overlap with Field of Research

Except for minimal risk circumstances approved by the OII, every Written Agreement must state that Outside Entities do not have the right to use the logo or name of any MGB entity in any form in any advertising, promotional or other public material without the prior written approval of the MGB entity involved.

- · A Covered Individual may use the name of a MGB entity (in connection with an Outside Activity) to identify the Individual's position or title at MGB, so long as the use, in the judgment of COA, does not imply MGB endorsement or responsibility for the Outside Activity, the Outside Entity, or the Outside Entity's product or services, unless otherwise restricted by COA.

Written Agreements:

- · Should clearly specify all of the services, including scope and field of those services, to be provided by the Covered Individual, and
- · Must not provide for services that compete or overlap inappropriately with the individual's obligations to MGB.

If the field of activity in any Outside Activity overlaps with the field of research conducted by the Covered Individual at or through MGB, then the following additional requirements apply.

- · If the Covered Individual's research at MGB is sponsored by the Outside Entity with which the Covered Individual is entering into the Written Agreement, the intellectual property provisions of the Written Agreement for the Outside Activity must not be so broad as to purport to grant to the Outside Entity ownership of or other rights in any intellectual property that may arise from, or relate to, the sponsored research agreement between the Outside Entity and MGB.
